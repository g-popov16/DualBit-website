							<p>I've always wanted to turn the world to the better</p>
							<p>I believe that there is a lot of potential in Bulgaria, however it isn't being utilized. That is why I believe that there should be a major shift in the
                                educational system, one that rewards thinking and creativity, rather than memorizing and regurgitating. I believe that using a system close to informal education is the right way to utilize young minds.
								What am I going to the about it? Well Firstly I will try to spread the word of what I learned using informal education at the American University in Bulgaria, 
								while I was there on a program organized by USYC. I believe that doing that will make people see the importance of a good educational system.						</p>
